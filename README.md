# Boat

![Boat](boat.gif)

This was a quick project to prove I understand and can use Blender and Unity, specifically the High Definition Render Pipeline (but I can also do the Universal and built-in pipelines). 

## The Boat Model
I made boat model from scratch in Blender. It was modelled after this boat:

These three textures (basket, blast_mold and steel) were taken from [poliigon.com](https://www.poliigon.com/).

## The Water
The water is the default High-Definition Render Pipeline ocean water. 

## Snow
The snow is a default particle system with some settings changed.

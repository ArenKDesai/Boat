# Boat

## The Boat Model
I made boat model from scratch in Blender. It was modelled after this boat:

![Brazillian Fishing Vessel](boat_model/pexels-gustavo-f-de-carvalho-souza-405357537-15190799.jpg)

These three textures (basket, blast_mold and steel) were taken from [poliigon.com](https://www.poliigon.com/).

## The Water
The water is just the default High-Definition Render Pipeline ocean water. 

## Snow
